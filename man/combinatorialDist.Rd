\title{Combinatrial model approximation of the number of motif hits}
\usage{
combinatorialDist(seqlen, overlap)
}
\arguments{
\item{seqlen}{Integer-valued vector that defines the lengths of the
individual sequences. This information can be extracted for 
given DNA sequence of interest using \code{\link{numMotifHits}}.
Note that as the combinatorial model only supports the analysis
of a set of sequences of equal length, each element `seqlen`
must be the same.}

\item{overlap}{List that contains the overlapping hit probabilities which
are determined by \code{\link{probOverlapHit}}}
}
\value{
List that contains 
\describe{
\item{dist}{Distribution of the number of motif hits}
}
}
\description{
This function approxmiates the distribution of the number of motif hits.
It is determined by efficiently  
summing over all combinations of obtaining k hits in a given sequence.
This function can be viewed as an alternative analytical approximation
to \code{\link{compoundPoissonDist}}.
Currently, the combinatorial model approximation is only supported
for scanning both strands of the DNA.
