\title{Enrichment test for a PFM in a provided DNA sequence based 
on the dynamic programming count model.
}
\description{
This method runs a statistical test based on the combinatorial
count model
of the number of motif hits in order to decide the whether
a PWM is enriched in a sequence of interest.
}
\usage{
dynprog.count.test(obs, overlap, maxhits)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{Is a list containing obs$seqlen, obs$numofseqs and obs$numofhits
which correspond to the length of each sequence fragment of interest, 
the number of sequence and the number of hits on the forward and reverse strand.
obs is returned by the function num.motifhits.}

\item{overlap}{Is a list that contains the overlap probabilities for the 
motif. It is computed by overlap.prob(). }
\item{maxhits}{Integer that sets the maximal number of motif hits.}
}
\examples{

library(mdist)
seqfile=system.file("extdata","seq.fasta", package="mdist")
pwmfile=system.file("extdata","x31.pwm", package="mdist")
alpha=0.001
gran=0.01
mdist.option(alpha, gran)

# estimate background model from seqfile
read.background(seqfile,1)

# load motif model from pwmfile
read.motif(pwmfile,"tab", 0.01)

# Compute overlap probability
op=overlap.prob()

# Determines whether the motif is significantly enriched in seqfile and
# returns the corresponding pvalue.
p.value=dynprog.count.test(num.motifhits(seqfile), op, maxhit=150)
