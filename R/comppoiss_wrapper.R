#' Overlapping motif hit probabilities
#' 
#' This function computes the self-overlapping probabilites of the motif for
#' the current PFM and background based on two-dimensional score distributions.
#' Subsequently, the overlapping hit probabilities are corrected for motif hits
#' that would arise in between the shifted positions.
#' 
#' 
#' @param singlestranded Boolian which defines whether the overlapping hit
#' probabilities shall be computed with respect to scanning both DNA strands or
#' only one strand.  Default: Both strands are scanned for DNA sequences.
#' @return A list containing various overlapping hit probabilities.
#' The list contains the following entries

#' Compound Poisson Approximation
#' 
#' This function computes the distribution of the number of motif hits 
#' that would be observe in a theoretical sequence of length 'L'
#' that is generated by the background model.
#' The distribution can be determine in two alternative ways: 
#' 1) We provide a reimplemented version of the algorithm that was
#' described in Pape et al. \emph{Compound poisson approximation 
#' of the number of occurrences of a position 
#' frequency matrix (PFM) on both strands.} 2008. In contrast to the
#' original model, this implementation can be used with higher-order
#' background models. This version
#' is used with method='pape'.
#' 2) We provide an improved compound Poisson approximation that
#' uses more appropriate statistical assumptions concerning 
#' overlapping motif hits and that can be used with higher-order
#' background models as well. The improved version can be used
#' with method='kopp'.
#' 
#' 
#' @param seqlen Vector of integers that contains the individual sequence
#' lengths of a given set of sequences. This information can be extracted for 
#' given DNA sequence of interest using \code{\link{numMotifHits}}.
#' In contrast to \code{\link{combinatorialDist}}, this function
#' supports variable length sequence to be considered.
#' @param overlap Overlapping hit probabilities. This argument is the result of
#' \code{link{probOverlapHit}}, which is essential for both.
#' @param method String that defines which method shall be invoked 'pape' or
#' 'kopp' (see description). Default: method='kopp'
