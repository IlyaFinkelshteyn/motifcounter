#' Combinatrial model approximation of the number of motif hits
#' 
#' This function approxmiates the distribution of the number of motif hits.
#' It is determined by efficiently  
#' summing over all combinations of obtaining k hits in a given sequence.
#' This function can be viewed as an alternative analytical approximation
#' to \code{\link{compoundPoissonDist}}.
#' Currently, the combinatorial model approximation is only supported
#' for scanning both strands of the DNA.
#' 
#' 
#' @param seqlen Integer-valued vector that defines the lengths of the
#' individual sequences. This information can be extracted for 
#' given DNA sequence of interest using \code{\link{numMotifHits}}.
#' Note that as the combinatorial model only supports the analysis
#' of a set of sequences of equal length, each element `seqlen`
#' must be the same.
#' @param overlap List that contains the overlapping hit probabilities which
#' are determined by \code{\link{probOverlapHit}}
#' @return List that contains 
#' \describe{
#' \item{dist}{Distribution of the number of motif hits}
#' }
