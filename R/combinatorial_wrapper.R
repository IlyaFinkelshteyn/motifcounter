#' Combinatrial model approximation of the number of motif hits
#'
#' This function approxmiates the distribution of the number of motif hits.
#' It sums over all combinations of obtaining k hits in a random sequence
#' of a given length using and efficient dynamic programming algorithm.
#' This function is an alternative to \code{\link{compoundPoissonDist}}.
#' However, it requires fixed-length sequences and currently
#' only supports the distribution of the number of hits when both
#' DNA strands are scanned for motif hits.
#'
#'
#' @param seqlen Integer-valued vector that defines the lengths of the
#' individual sequences. This information can be extracted for
#' given DNA sequence of interest using \code{\link{numMotifHits}} or
#' \code{\link{lenSequences}}. 
#' @param overlap Overlap-object that contains the overlapping 
#' hit probabilities. An Overlap-object is created by 
#' \code{\link{probOverlapHit}}
#' @return List that contains
#' \describe{
#' \item{dist}{Distribution of the number of motif hits}
